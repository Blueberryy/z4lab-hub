# z4lab-hub

main plugin installed on all our servers, currently WIP - this is my first *"real"* plugin and I'm still new to SourcePawn so keep that in mind :)

## features 
- welcome message for players
- custom chat commands like: `!rules` or `!discord`
- hintbox trigger for stuff like `!ws` (displays red NO message)
- rotating chat information (like next map, commands, etc)

## planned
- everything stored in cfg file so it can be used by others without the need of recompiling and chaning sourcecode
